# Dict.cc-parsing

### About
Simple parser for Dict.cc dictionary. It was made and tested with the DE<>EN dictionary but should work for all dict.cc dictionaries.

### How to use it

1. Download the dictionary of your choice from Dict.cc. For more details visit https://www.dict.cc/?s=about%3Awordlist
2. Open the txt file and remove everything else ***EXCEPT*** the dictionary entries (no empty lines). You still need to respect their terms and conditions (which can be found here https://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e )
3. Download and run the function
4. Use the pandas dataframe returned by the function as you like (provided you respect dict.cc terms of use)
